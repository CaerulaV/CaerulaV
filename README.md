Hello!

  I am Caerula Viridis! You can call me Cae though. I have been working on the COCO orginization for some time now, (I am the founder... yes) and it would be nice if someone else could join... I need help, you can see on the C O C O page (https://caerulav.github.io/coco.2000.mi/) what were workings on, and it would be great if "we" could get some help! 
  Terms?
 You may need at least some coding expirence (even the most baisic, like, block coding level even) If you would like to join, just see my page for more info!
